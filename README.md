## Introduction

Welcome to Hotshots - the tactical miniature naval warfare game that transforms the classic Battleship board game into an intense battle of one-tile-sized ships equipped with unique abilities! In this game, strategy, quick decision-making, and clever maneuvering are key to victory.

## Features

- **Miniature Naval Warfare:** All ships are reduced to a one-tile size, intensifying the strategic depth of the game.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Ships can move, shoot, scan for enemy locations, and defend against incoming attacks.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Challenge your friends online to prove who the ultimate Hotshot commander is.


## Gameplay

Hotshots retains the core concept of Battleship but introduces new elements:

1. **Movement:** Ships can move one tile in any direction during their turn.
2. **Shooting:** Fire at enemy positions on the grid to damage their ships.
3. **Scanning:** Use the scanning ability to reveal a small portion of the enemy's grid.
4. **Defending:** Activate your ship's defensive ability to reduce damage from incoming attacks.
